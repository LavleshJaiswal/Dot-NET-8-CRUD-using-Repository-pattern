<h3><strong>.NET 8: CRUD Operations Using Repository Pattern</strong></h4>
<hr>
In this project, I have implemented a simple CRUD operation for a "Student" entity using the <strong>Repository Pattern and Entity Framework Code-First Approach.</strong> <br>
Additionally, exceptions are handled seamlessly using custom middleware for better error management.
