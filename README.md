<h3><strong>.NET 8: CRUD Operations Using Repository Pattern</strong></h4>
<hr>
In this project, I have implemented a simple CRUD operation for a "Student" entity using the <strong>Repository Pattern and Entity Framework Code-First Approach.</strong> <br>
Additionally, exceptions are handled seamlessly using custom middleware for better error management.
To manage the ConnectionString based on Environment see this <a href="https://github.com/LavleshJaiswal/setup-Dot-net-8-project-based-on-Environment-">setup-Dot-net-8-project-based-on-Environment-<a/>
